Hackers' and Hitchhikers' Guide to The Fireworks Project
========================================================
This is a collection of documents created and maintained by the members of [The
Fireworks Project][1] as a sort of owners' manual. The published guide can be
found at [www.fireworksproject.com/guide/overview][3].

The document collection source is written in [Markdown][2] format. You can find
all the source files in the `src/` folder.  Markdown is used for easy
conversion to other publishing formats later in the project lifetime. (As soon
as we have time)

The published document collection can be found in the `/dist` folder in HTML and CSS.
