#Rules to Voting Points in the Fireworks Project

Your compensations for work in the Fireworks project by recieving points.  You are also responsible for distributing points to your fellow active members and contributing non-members.  There are:


1. Points represent equity in the company. 
2. You can only vote points to other members and new members if you were awarded points the previous month (this is known as being an active member). 
3. You can't vote any one member more points than you already have (e.g. If I have 10 points and I am an active member, I cannot vote any one person more than 10 points).
4. You can't vote points to yourself.

That's pretty much it.
