*Q: Do you guys know what you're doing?*

#A: Sort of.

If you are asking us about our technical prowess, than yes, we do feel confident in what we are doing. 

If you're asking us about our unique corporate structure, than yes, we sort of know what we're doing.  Not many (if any) companies are 100% open, and 100% member owned and operated. The way equity is distributed is experimental and lacking (by design) in structure.
