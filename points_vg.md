#Fireworks Project Points Explained 

Points represent equity, or ownership, in the Fireworks Project.  Recieving points is how you are compensated for your contribution to the Fireworks Project.  Each active member votes points to other active members or contributing non-members once a month.  

If you own one or more points, you are entitled to:

- Your share of profits the Fireworks Project generates *(e.g. if you own one point and all the points of every member combine is 10, you are entitiled to 10% of the profits)*.
- Your share of voting rights on corporate decisions *(e.g. if there were proposed changes to the corporate structure, or operating agreement, the you can vote the number of points you have)*.

The equity you acrue (via points) in the Fireworks Project are yours and yours alone.  You cannot give/sell your points to anyone else.  If you decide to stop working with the Fireworks Project, your points will always be your points and you will continue to recive your share of profits for as long as this system is in place.
