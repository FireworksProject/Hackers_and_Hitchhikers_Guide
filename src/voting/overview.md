##Step 4: You Got Questions, We Kinda Got Answers

Even if you have read everything above (and let's be honest, you probably haven't) you should have questions.  We have tried to address as many of them as we can:

- Why start a  [Member Owned and Opperated Open-Source Company] [7]?
- There isn't a lot of [Structure] [15] to your voting system. Why is that?
- Are you a totally [Vitual Company] [12]?
- Do you really think you're going to [Make Money] [9] by doing this?
- If I contribute to the Fireworks Project, how do I [Get Paid] [14]?
- What kind of [Strategy] [8] should I use when voting?
- The system you use for voting seems really.....uuuuuhhhhh.....bad. Are you going to [fix it] [10]?
- There seems to be basic [economic issues] [11] with the point system. Have you addressed that?
- [Do you guys know what you're doing] [13]?

There is also a good chance we haven't addressed your question. Please feel free to post them on the Basecamp site somewhere.  Someone will try to hash it out with you.
