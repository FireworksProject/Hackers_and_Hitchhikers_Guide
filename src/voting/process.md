[Back to points voting overview.](overview)

Voting Process
==============

Around the 3rd or 4th of the month, someone in The Fireworks Project creates a
monthly review on our [Google Group] [2] to recap what has been done within the
company (this is an [April, 2010 Recap] [3]).  On a monthly review, you can
expect to see the following:

1. A spread sheet of the Fireworks Project financials (This is [April's Financials] [4]).
2. A recap of all the activity on Fireworks Basecamp page and who has participated.
3. A recap of the code developed and who has contributed.
4. A recap of the current active members (i.e. who is eligible to vote points)
and a spread sheet of the current point totals for every member (this is
[April's Point Total] [5]). 

**After that, you are asked to vote points (if you are a current member) to
other members and recruits who you deem worthy of receiving points. It is
recommended, but not mandatory, that you give the reasoning for your voting. For
now, you must vote points on the monthly review thread.**
