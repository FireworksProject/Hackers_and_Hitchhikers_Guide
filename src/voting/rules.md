Rules to Voting Points
======================

Your compensations for work in the Fireworks project is by receiving points.
You are also responsible for distributing points to your fellow contributing
members. There are some things to keep in when voting points:


1. Points represent equity in the company. 
2. You can only vote points to other members and new members if you were
   awarded points the previous month (this is known as being an active member). 
3. You can't vote any one member more points than you already have (e.g. If I
   have 10 points and I am an active member, I cannot vote any one person more
   than 10 points).
4. You can't vote points to yourself.

That's pretty much it.
