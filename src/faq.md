### We do things a little unorthodoxly.

If you're still scratching your head after reading our [Point Voting
Guide](voting/overview), you're not alone.  Knowing we're a
little....different, we will try to explain ourselves as best we can.

- Seriously....[Do you guys know what you're doing](faq#do_you_know_what_you_are_doing)?

### Q: Do you guys know what you're doing?
<a>

### A: Sort of.

If you are asking us about our technical prowess, than yes, we do feel
confident in what we are doing. 

If you're asking us about our unique corporate structure, than yes, we know
what we're doing, *sort of*.  

Not many (if any) companies are 100% open, and 100% member owned and operated.  That means, everything we do is out in the open, for everyone to see. There are no backroom meetings, no loop to worry about being in, and no one acting as "The Hand of God" making decisions that are not explained.  All decisions are created by the members (those who have contributed to the Fireworks Project) and consensus is built.  Everyone brings ideas to the table, and the best one riese to the top.

Once you're able to wrap your head around the concept, you'll see that we are creating the company you've always wanted to work for.  No more inept bosses to deal with.  No more going unnoticed in the office. No more pointless job requirements. No more doing things you are not interested in.  No more TPS reports and no more PC Load Letter.  

However, we know this type company isn't for everyone.

Many people thrive in a structured environment; 9 to 5, daily to-do lists, weekly scheduled meeting, being told what to do.  And if that is you, you will not like working with us. 

We are self starters. We are big picture guys but are able to do the mundane little things that make the big picture happen.  We know when to lead and we know when to follow. We know we have awesome ideas, but we know other people usually have better ones. We start work at 2am, or 1 pm or whenever it suits us. We work on Sundays and we take days off when we want to.  We don't let a scheduel dictate us, we dictate our schedule.

And that is where the *Sort Of* comes in. Not everyone can work like that and we understand that. But we think there are enough people out there that are sick of the same ole, and will want to join.


Are we crazy? Yes. Crazy like a fox.
