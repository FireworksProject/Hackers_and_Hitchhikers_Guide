### We do things a little unorthodoxly.

If you're still scratching your head after reading our [Point Voting
Guide](voting/overview), you're not alone.  Knowing we're a
little....different, we will try to explain ourselves as best we can.

- Seriously....[Do you guys know what you're doing](faq#do_you_know_what_you_are_doing)?

### Q: Do you guys know what you're doing?
<a>

### A: Sort of.

If you are asking us about our technical prowess, than yes, we do feel
confident in what we are doing. 

If you're asking us about our unique corporate structure, than yes, we know
what we're doing, *sort of*.  

Not many (if any) companies are 100% open, and 100% member owned and operated.  This type of corporate structure (or lack thereof) flattens out the ridged management hierarchy present in almost all companies.  We allow this to happen by giving each member the ability to evaluate all other members and new recruits with our equity point voting system.

This structure is both enticing and scary all at the same time.

The Fireworks Project allows its members to define what the Fireworks Project is and how to use it.  The Fireworks project has established a [a few rules for voting points](voting/rules) and developed a few [frameworks](link needed). And that's about it.  The members are the defining the rest. This is all by design.

The Fireworks Project members are allotted an enormous amount of freedom by not being constrained by an abundance of rules, official procedures, protocols and a boss looking over their shoulder.  It's liberating.

However, this structure is untested and inherently unstable. This is where the *Sort Of* comes in. 

An abundance of structure provides stability. Most people like stability which would make working for The Fireworks Project very difficult (content Mircosoft employees, I'm looking at you). And we know that.  We are well aware that there is a chance that our structure might not work. We belive most people don't want to be lemmings, but we could be wrong.

But we firmly belive that giving up some of the stability blanket will allow us to do some amazing things; have a company that can turn on a dime, not get Zuckerberged, see our monthly takehome reflect how much work we put into the company and work with peers, not with bosses.  We want that.

Are we crazy? Yes. Crazy like a fox.
