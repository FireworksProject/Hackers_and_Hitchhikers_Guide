### We do things a little unorthodoxly.

If you're still scratching your head after reading our [Point Voting
Guide](voting/overview), you're not alone.  Knowing we're a
little....different, we will try to explain ourselves as best we can.

- Seriously....[Do you guys know what you're doing](faq#do_you_know_what_you_are_doing)?

### Q: Do you guys know what you're doing?
<a>

### A: Sort of.

If you are asking us about our technical prowess, than yes, we do feel
confident in what we are doing. 

If you're asking us about our unique corporate structure, than yes, we know
what we're doing, *sort of*.  Not many (if any) companies are 100% open, and
100% member owned and operated. The way equity is distributed is experimental
and lacking in structure (by design).
