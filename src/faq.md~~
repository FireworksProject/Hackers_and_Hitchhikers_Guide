<a class="question" name="do_you_know_what_you_are_doing">
### Q: Do you guys know what you're doing?
</a>

### A: Sort of.

If you are asking us about our technical prowess, than yes, we do feel
confident in what we are doing. 

If you're asking us about our unique corporate structure, than yes, we know
what we're doing, *sort of*.  

Not many (if any) companies are 100% open, and 100% member owned and operated.  That means, everything we do is out in the open, for everyone to see. There are no backroom meetings, no loop to worry about being in, and no one acting as "The Hand of God" making decisions that are not explained.  All decisions are created by the members (those who have contributed to the Fireworks Project) and consensus is built.  Everyone brings ideas to the table, and the best one riese to the top.

Once you're able to wrap your head around the concept, you'll see that we are creating the company you've always wanted to work for.  No more inept bosses to deal with.  No more going unnoticed in the office. No more pointless job requirements. No more doing things you are not interested in.  No more TPS reports and no more PC Load Letter.  

However, we know this type company isn't for everyone.

Many people thrive in a structured environment; 9 to 5, daily to-do lists, weekly scheduled meetings and predicability.  While predictability is pretty boring, fact is, most people love the safety of predictability. 

Predictablity is not a luxury we have in the web technology industry. 

We've stripped away many of the layers of structure in order to stay nimble and pivot when we see fit.  Instead of a waiting for the top management to make a decision, we only need one member to start a project and convince others it's the right path.  We give away the predictability of a day to day job and trade it in for the ability to have our chance at defining the future.

And that is where the *Sort Of* comes in. There is a lot to wrap your head around when working with us.  There are a lot of preconcieved notions about a work environment you need to toss out. There is a lot of self motivation involved.  There is a lot of trust you need to place in others you've never met before.  You have to be prepared to pull a "Star Ship Enterprise" and go where no one else has gone before.  And all of that is a pretty scary proposition. We're not sure how exactly it's going to work. But we're confident it will work.

<a class="question" name="how_should_I_evaluate_other_members">
###Q: How should I evaluate other memebers?
</a>

###A: It's your call.

First, if you own points, remember that The Fireworks Project is your company and your team. It is your
responsibility to pick out other members that you want to continue to work
with and also to recruit new members that you think will add value to the
membership. It is also up to the collective membership to elevate our most
competent members into leadership roles by boosting their valuations.

Your tool for affecting these decisions is the number of points you choose to
vote, and which members to vote them to. Here are some examples:

You can **“terminate”** other members by refusing to vote points to them. In
that case you should also state why you think this person should no longer
get any points so the rest of the membership can see your reasoning.

You can **recruit** new members by telling them about us, getting them to
sign up, and then introducing them to established members. You can also
vote them a good chunk of points in the beginning to give them a toehold and
encourage them to get more involved.

You can **recognize valuable work** by other members by voting extra points to
them and letting everyone else on the mailing list know why you think they are
so valuable.

You can **recognize valuable projects**, or encourage members to join you on a
project by promising to vote points to them for their efforts. For example,
you could promise 5% of the company points at the next vote to anyone who helps
you redesign the website, assuming you have the points to back it up.

You can also help **promote members** whom you think have leadership qualities.
The best way to do this is to help them gain a high valuation by voting large
amounts of points to them each month.

The possibilities are almost endless. So, although it is not mandated, it is a
good idea to write a short sentence or two about your strategy and post it with
your votes so other members can understand what you are doing.

###Q: Is your company totally virtual?
</a>

###A: Yes!

The idea of having a company live completely online isn't exactly a novel one anymore.
