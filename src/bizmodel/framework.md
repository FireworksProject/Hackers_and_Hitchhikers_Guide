Orientation; A Framework for new markets.
-----------------------------------------
The second phase of our OODA loop is orientation. Most of our ability to
reorient ourselves comes from our own life experiences, environment, and our
intuition. However, we can also construct a dynamic framework to help us
reorient our business model based on our observations. This framework should
never be set in stone, but revised on each iteration of the OODA loop.

### Noncustomers
* First tier, refusing customers. (todo: explain)
* Second tier, soon to be noncustomers. (todo: explain)
* Third tier, ignored customers. (todo: explain)


### Tactics for creating markets out of noncustomers.

#### Build the future. (What is our leap of faith idea?)
Mark Zuckerberg commented that if he didn't build Facebook "somebody else would
have." He obviously had a clear understanding that there was a trend line which
predicted the success of Facebook. However, while plenty of people predicted
it, he is the only one who actually built it.

One of the biggest differentators of wildly successful firms is not so much
that they predict the future, but that they define it. It may seem that Mark
Zuckerberg is being humble by quipping that somebody else would have built
Facebook if he didn't; but the fact of the matter remains that he did build it.

By his own admission everyone saw the trend, but Mark will be a billionaire
because he *built* the future that everyone else *predicted*.  What do you get
by predicting the future? You get to say "I was right", along with millions of
other people.

So, the goal of The Fireworks Project is not necessarily to be "right" about
our predictions, but to build a firm that will *make* our predictions right.
What is our leap of faith?

#### The forgotten masses.
We are not going to waste our time and brain power targeting the markets of the
big players like Google and Apple, just to get the leftoever scraps. Instead,
we'll be fishing in the ocean of the forgotten masses instead.

This is not to say that we will not compete, but that we need to carefully
choose were and how we compete.  The armies of Napoleon Bonaparte and George
Washington were able to defeat larger and better equipped forces because they
chose the battles to fight; and they defined how they would be fought.

The point here is not that there is room for better enterprise software and
social network platforms in the existing marketplace. Anyone can build better
alternatives to Microsoft or Facebook, but copying the market view of Microsoft
or Facebook is a fool's errand. Where are Microsoft, Google, and Apple
uncomfortable?  What are some places they they don't want to go, or are unable
to go? We must always maintain a contrarian model of the world when compared to
the large market makers.

Of course the only way to have a contrarian model of the World, is to
understand the models we are running contrary to. Fighting in the woods is
contrary to fighting pitched battles out in the open.

#### Appeal to emotion.
As this is written in September of 2010 Apple Inc. has hit a lifetime high of
$285 per share. Their iPhone and iPad products are continuing to exceed market
expectations.  Everyone wants to follow the Apple formula for success, and for
good reason.

Perhaps the most valuable lesson to learn from Apple is that emotional appeal
matters.  Apple did not invent the mp3 player, the smartphone, or the tablet.
What Apple did is make massive numbers of people desire these products to such
extent that they are willing to pay high margin prices for them.

Apple did this by creating appealing designs and unmatched utility for their
products.  Their attention to user experience design created a feedback loop
with their devoted customers; the Apple tribe. This feedback loop has generated
a level of desire so strong that in some circles having an Apple product is
considered a need.

There is an old adage in the advertising industry:
  > "Every man is actually two men. The man he is, and the man he wants to be."

Other market players falter because they forget to appeal to human emotion and
believe their products will stand on their technical merits alone. Apple's
success shows this to be a dangerous assumption. (The Zune anybody?)

We need to find the places in the market that have not been introduced to
emotional appealing products and services. Apple found the mp3 player, smart
phone, and tablet markets were weak in this area. What markets can we find?

#### Find a niche that does not yet exist.
One of the worst things we could do is attempt to be the best player within
some existing technology market. That instict is part of our consumer
mentality, and it is not healthy for an entrepreneurial mentality.  If we based
our business on building a better word processing system, we would have to
fight for our lives just to squeeze out a meager living.  The entrepreneurial
attitude is to invent a new market where we are the *only* player (at least for
a little while).

To create a new market requires that we understand whole market ecosystem.
Buyers have plenty of choices in front of them and they will always make the
one that most suites their needs and appeals to them on an emotional level the
most. It is these choices that buyers are making within fractions of a second
that form market dynamics.

For example, small business customers will evaluate online software against an
actual physical filing cabinet, email, Excel, Google Apps, and even a pen and
paper.  These things all have different forms and functionality, but they all
serve the same purpose.  They allow a small business manager to organize
information in a way that is good enough to effectively manage their business.

To exploring outside existing functionality we need to understand what a market
is trying to achieve in the broadest terms.  For example, small businesses are
not really out looking for an "enterprise resource management system"; what
they are really looking for is a way to get more done in less time without
having to worry about the day to day details of the business.

When we help a segment of the population meet their objectives in a way that is
obviously superior to their current mode of operation, we have found a niche
market that does not exist.

#### Steal ideas.
Everything new is actually just a derivative. Look at Apple and Microsoft.
Steal liberally; it's not a bad thing.

(todo: more)

#### Get in bed with the big players.
Establish mutually beneficial ties with bigger market makers; so they have an interest in our success.

(todo: more)

#### Discover our real customers.
Who do we actually want to sell to? Maybe everyone else forgot to market to somebody that
actually wants to buy.
