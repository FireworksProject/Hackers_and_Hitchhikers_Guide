Noncustomers
-------------
First tier, refusing customers.
Second tier, soon to be noncustomers.
Third tier, ignored customers.


Tactics for creating markets out of noncustomers.
--------------------------------------------------

### Build the future. (What is our leap of faith idea?)
Mark Zuckerberg commented that if he didn't build Facebook "somebody else would
have." He obviously had a clear understanding that there was a trend line which
predicted the success of Facebook. However, while plenty of people predicted
it, he is the only one who actually built it.

One of the biggest differentators of wildly successful firms is not so much
that they predict the future, but that they define it. It may seem that Mark
Zuckerberg is being humble by quipping that somebody else would have built
Facebook if he didn't; but the fact of the matter remains that he did build it.

By his own admission everyone saw the trend, but Mark will be a billionaire
because he *built* the future that everyone else *predicted*.  What do you get
by predicting the future? You get to say "I was right", along with millions of
other people.

So, the goal of The Fireworks Project is not necessarily to be "right" about
our predictions, but to build a firm that will *make* our predictions right.
What is our leap of faith?

### The forgotten masses.
We are too smart and too talented to target the markets of the big players in
our industry. So, we'll be fishing in the ocean of the forgotten masses
instead.

This is not to say that we will not compete, but we need to carefully choose
were and how those competitions are faught.  The armies of Napoleon Bonaparte
and George Washington were able to defeat larger and better equipped forces
because they chose the battles to fight; and they defined how they would be
fought.

Where are Microsoft, Google, and Apple uncomfortable?  What are some places
they simply will not go? We need to understand how they have carved up the
market to find the opportunities presented to us.

The point here is not that there is no room for better enterprise software and
social network platforms, but that copying the market view of IBM or Facebook
is a fool's errand. We must always maintain a contrarian model of the world
when compared to the large market makers.

Of course the only way to have a contrarian model of the World, is to
understand the models we are running contrary to. Fighting in the woods is
contrary to fighting pitched battles out in the open.

### Appeal to emotion.
As this is written in September of 2010 Apple Inc. has hit a lifetime high of
$285 per share. Their iPhone and iPad products are continuing to exceed market
expectations.  Everyone wants to follow the Apple formula for success, and for
good reason.

Perhaps the most valuable lesson to learn from Apple is that emotional appeal matters.
Apple did not invent the mp3 player, the smartphone, or the tablet. What Apple did
is make massive numbers of people desire these products to such extent that they are
willing to pay high margin prices for them.

Apple did this by creating appealing designs and unmatched utility for their products.
Their attention to user experience design created a feedback loop with their devoted
customers; the Apple tribe. This feedback loop has generated a level of desire so strong
among consumers that in some circles having an Apple product is considered a need.

There is an old adage in the advertising industry:
  > "Every man is actually two men. The man he is, and the man he wants to be."

Other market players falter because they forget to appeal to human emotion and believe
their products will stand on their technical merits alone. Apple's success shows this
to be a dangerous assumption. (The Zune anybody?)

We need to find the places in the market that have not been found by emotional appealing
products and services. Apple found the mp3 player, smart phone, and tablet markets were
weak in this area. What markets can we find?

### Find a niche that does not yet exist.
One of the worst things we could do is attempt to be the best player within
some existing technology market. That instict is part of our consumer
mentality, and it is not healthy for an entrepreneurial mentality.  If we based
our business on building a better word processing system, we would have to
fight for our lives just to squeeze out a meager living.  The entrepreneurial
attitude is to invent a new market where we are the *only* player (at least for
a little while).

To create a new market requires that we understand whole market ecosystem.
Buyers have plenty of choices in front of them and they will always make the
one that most suites their needs and appeals to them on an emotional level the
most. It is these choices that form markets for our ideas.

For example, small business customers will evaluate online software against an
actual physical filing cabinet, email, Excel, Google Apps, and even a pen and
paper.  These things all have different forms and functionality, but they all
serve the same purpose.  They allow a small business manager to organize
information in a way that is good enough to effectively manage their business.
We need to look for untapped value in the spaces between existing functionality
and purpose.

Exploring outside existing functionality and purpose means understanding what
the market is trying to achieve in the broadest terms.  For example, small
businesses are not looking for an "enterprise resource management system", they
are simply trying to get more done in less time without having to worry about
the day to day details of the business.

When we help a segment of the population meet their objectives in a way that is
obviously superior to their current mode of operation, we have found a niche
market that does not exist.

### Steal ideas.
Everything new is actually just a derivative. Look at Apple and Microsoft.
Steal liberally; it's not a bad thing.

### Get in bed with the big players.
Establish mutually beneficial ties with bigger market makers; so they have an interest in our success.

### Discover our real customers.
Who do we actually want to sell to? Maybe everyone else forgot to market to somebody that
actually wants to buy.

Aug 30th, 2010
According to IT research firm AMI's latest worldwide SMB Cloud Services
Practice, there are roughly 750,000 (12 percent) small businesses and 20,000
(24 percent) medium-size businesses already using software as a service (SAAS).
In addition, the survey found by looking at today's SAAS users, 78 percent of
small businesses and 31 percent of midsize businesses are leveraging a SAAS
plus on-premises mix (or hybrid model), while approximately only a third of
SAAS users are using an actual pure-SAAS product.

With an anticipated growth of up to $95 billion in global SMB cloud-related
spending by 2014, the firm said it isn't a surprise to see over half of U.S.
SMBs looking into SAAS as a potential solution. Approximately one in five U.S.
SMBs plan to use SAAS. However, AMI said it believes that SMBs are easing into
the concept of local plus cloud-based computing rather than leapfrogging into a
pure-play platform.

AMI's research concluded that certain applications would accelerate the need
for on demand/cloud among SMBs from SAAS plus on-premises vendors, including
e-mail and messaging applications, online storage and backup, and document
management and collaboration solutions. Approximately 134,000 non-SAAS U.S. SMB
users plan to adopt this application, according to the company's report, which
is good news for companies like Microsoft, which not only provides hosted
solutions like Exchange Online in its BPOS bundle, but also its ubiquitous
"Exchange On Premises."
