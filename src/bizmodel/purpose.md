Purpose; make a statement.
--------------------------
Throughout the OODA loop it will help to have a central purpose in mind.  This
purpose should be revisited and revised on every iteration of the loop; just
like every other aspect of our business. However, there is one constant the
will remain in place throughout all of our interations: The Fireworks Project
exists to [build something that matters][1].

> The Fireworks Project mission: to build, organize, and integrate internet applications, making them universally accessible and useful for everyone.

Internet technologies are advancing rapidly and have been disjointed as a
consequence. [Early technology adopters][2] have no problem thriving
in the fractured environment of internet application technology; that much we
know. However, the same characteristics of internet technologies that excite
early adopters is preventing the majority of potential internet application
users from accessing the tremendous utility that internet technology is able to
deliver. This is where our opportunity lies.

We do not take the stance that the pace of innovation needs to be slowed, but
that we can package fractured internet technology as a whole product for
late majority adopters while continuing to innovate at a rapid pace. The
majority of the potential market for any technological innovation exists with
the pragmatic individuals that need it packaged and delivered in a way which
allows them to immediately put it to use. As this is written in 2010, there is
no market sector that achieves that.

Imagine yourself in 1908, riding in a horse drawn carriage, going past a broken
down motorist stuck on the side of the road. In those days motoring was a
hobby, mostly enjoyed by wealthy individuals. You would probably scoff from the
seat of your carriage and carry on, shaking your head. Why would somebody waste
so much money on such a useless toy?

Then, several years later, around 1914, cars became more affordable and
reliable, thanks to the [assembly lines of the Ford Motor company][3]. Now as
more of your neighbors are purchasing cars you begin to see their usefulness.
Soon, your pragmatic nature convinces you that owning a car may actually be a
good idea.

The early adopters of automobiles were tinkerers. The same is true of internet
technologies today. We want to change that so that everyone with internet
access, early adopters and pragmatic followers alike, has access to useful
internet applications.
