> The Fireworks Project mission: to organize and integrate internet applications, making them universally accessible and useful.

Internet technologies are advancing rapidly and have been disjointed as a
concequence. The number of applications available for something as simple as
email is mind numbing. The fracturing of internet application technology suites
the mindset of [early technology adopters][1]; that much we know. However, the
same thing that excites early adopters is preventing the majority of potential
internet application users from accessing the tremendous utility that internet
technology is able to deliver. This is where our opportunity lies.

We do not take the stance that the pace of innovation needs to be slowed, but
that we can package fractured internet technology as a whole product for
late majority adopters while continuing to innnovate at a rapid pace. The
majority of the potential market for any technological innovation exists with
the pragmatic individuals that need it packaged and delivered in a way which
allows them to immediately put it to use. As this is written in 2010, there is
no market sector that achieves that.

Imagine yourself in 1908, riding in a horse drawn carriage, going past a broken
down motorist stuck on the side of the road. In those days motoring was a
hobby, mostly enjoyed by wealthy individuals. You would probably scoff from the
seat of your carriage and carry on, shaking your head. Why would sombody waste
so much money on such a useless toy?

Then, several years later, around 1914, cars became more affordable and
reliable, thanks to the [assembly lines of the Ford Motor company][2]. Now as
more of your neighbors are purchasing cars you began to see their usefullness.
Soon, your pragmatic nature convinces you that owning a car may actually be a
good idea.

The early adopters of automobiles were tinkerers. The same is true of internet
technologies today. We want to change that so that everyone with internet
access, early adopters and pragmatic followers alike, has access to useful
internet applications.
