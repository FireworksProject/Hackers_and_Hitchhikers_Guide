Internet technologies are advancing rapidly and have been disjointed as a
concequence. The number of applications available to choose from for something
as simple as answering emails is mind numbing. While this fracturing suites
[early technology adopters][1], the majority of internet users are left to fend
for themselves. This is where our opportunity lies.

We are not arguing that the pace of innovation needs to be slowed, but that we
can package fractured internet technology it as a whole product. The majority
of the potential market for any technological innovation exists with the
pragmatic individuals that need it packaged and delivered in a way which allows
them to immediately put it to use. As this is written in 2010, there is no
package or service that achieves that.

Imagine yourself in 1908, riding in a horse drawn carriage, going past a broken
down motorist stuck on the side of the road. In those days motoring was a
hobby, mostly enjoyed by wealthy individuals. You would probably scoff from the
seat of your carriage and carry on, shaking your head. Why would sombody waste
so much money on such a useless toy?

Then, several years later, around 1914, cars became more affordable and
reliable, thanks to the [assembly lines of the Ford Motor company][2]. Now as
more of your neighbors are able to purchased cars you began to see their
usefullness. Soon, your pragmatic nature convinces you that owning a car may
actually be a good idea.

The early adopters of automobiles were tinkerers. The same is true of internet
technologies today. We want to change that so that everyone with internet
access, early adopters and pragmatic followers alike, is convinced that having
a Personal Internet account is a good idea.
