Internet technologies are advancing rapidly and have been disjointed as a
concequence. The number of applications I have to choose from to perform
something as simple as answering emails is mind numbing. While this fracturing
suites [early technology adopters][1] the majority are being ignored. This is
where the opportunity lies.

We are not arguing that the pace of innovation needs to be slowed, but that we
can package fractured internet technology it as a whole product. The majority
of the potential market for any technological innovation exists with the
pragmatic individuals that need it packaged and delivered in some way allows
them to immediately put it to use. As this is written in 2010, there is no
package or service that achieves that.

Imagine yourself in 1908, riding in a horse drawn carriage, going past a
motorist stuck on the side of the road because of a breakdown. In those days
motoring was a hobby, mostly enjoyed by wealthy individuals. You would probably
scoff from the seat of your carriage and carry on, shaking your head. Why would
sombody waste so much money on such a useless toy?

Then, several years later, around 1914, cars became more affordable and
reliable, thanks to the [assembly lines of the Ford Motor company][2]. Now as
more of your neighbors are able to purchase cars you begin to see their
usefullness. Soon, your pragmatic nature convinces that owning a car may
actually be a good idea.
