According to IT research firm AMI's latest worldwide SMB Cloud Services
Practice, there are roughly 750,000 (12 percent) small businesses and 20,000
(24 percent) medium-size businesses already using software as a service (SAAS).
In addition, the survey found by looking at today's SAAS users, 78 percent of
small businesses and 31 percent of midsize businesses are leveraging a SAAS
plus on-premises mix (or hybrid model), while approximately only a third of
SAAS users are using an actual pure-SAAS product.

With an anticipated growth of up to $95 billion in global SMB cloud-related
spending by 2014, the firm said it isn't a surprise to see over half of U.S.
SMBs looking into SAAS as a potential solution. Approximately one in five U.S.
SMBs plan to use SAAS. However, AMI said it believes that SMBs are easing into
the concept of local plus cloud-based computing rather than leapfrogging into a
pure-play platform.

AMI's research concluded that certain applications would accelerate the need
for on demand/cloud among SMBs from SAAS plus on-premises vendors, including
e-mail and messaging applications, online storage and backup, and document
management and collaboration solutions. Approximately 134,000 non-SAAS U.S. SMB
users plan to adopt this application, according to the company's report, which
is good news for companies like Microsoft, which not only provides hosted
solutions like Exchange Online in its BPOS bundle, but also its ubiquitous
"Exchange On Premises."
