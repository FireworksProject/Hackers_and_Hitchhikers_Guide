<h1>Points Explained </h1>

<p>Points represent equity, or ownership, in the Fireworks Project.  Receiving
points is how you are compensated for your contribution to the Fireworks
Project.  Each active member votes points to other contributing members once a
month.  </p>

<p>If you own one or more points, you are entitled to:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Your share of profits the Fireworks Project generates <em>(e.g. if you own one
point and all the points of every member combine is 10, you are entitled to
10% of the profits)</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Your share of voting rights on corporate decisions <em>(e.g. if there were
proposed changes to the corporate structure, or operating agreement, the you
can vote the number of points you have)</em>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The equity you accrue (via points) in the Fireworks Project is yours and yours
alone. You cannot give or sell your points to anyone else. If you decide to
stop working with the Fireworks Project, your points will always be your points
and you will continue to receive your share of profits for as long as this
system is in place.</p>
