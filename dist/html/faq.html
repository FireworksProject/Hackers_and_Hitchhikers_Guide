<h3>We do things a little unorthodoxly.</h3>

<p>If you're still scratching your head after reading our <a href="voting/overview">Point Voting
Guide</a>, you're not alone.  Knowing we're a
little....different, we will try to explain ourselves as best we can.</p>

<h3>Q: Do you guys know what you're doing?</h3>

<p><a></p>

<h3>A: Sort of.</h3>

<p>If you are asking us about our technical prowess, than yes, we do feel
confident in what we are doing. </p>

<p>If you're asking us about our unique corporate structure, than yes, we know
what we're doing, <em>sort of</em>.  Not many (if any) companies are 100% open, and
100% member owned and operated. The way equity is distributed is experimental
and lacking in structure (by design). </p>
