	<h1><strong id="headstrong">A startup is a search</strong>
		for a scalable and repeatable business model.</h1>

	<p>The biggest advantage we have as a small start up is our agility; so we need
	to completely leverage that agility the best that we can.  To do that we use
	dynamic business modeling that is able to change quickly as we learn more about
	our market and how to build products for it.  Our business model is not about
	being right the first time, but <em>getting</em> to the right model as quickly and
	cheaply as possible.</p>

	<p>In fact, there are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Plan-Breaking-Through-Business/dp/1422126692">whole books</a> written about being wrong the first time, second time, and third time.
	The theory is that our first idea will never work, and the idea after that probably
	will not either. The important thing is to keep moving to the next idea;
	triangulating in on something that does work.

	<p>Changing from one idea to the next is called a <a
		href="http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/06/pivot-dont-jump-to-new-vision.html">pivot</a>.
	As far as we're concerned, the whole purpose of a startup is to search and
	pivot. And, of course, ehere is a methodology for doing this that has become known as
	the <a
		href="http://adam.heroku.com/past/2010/4/30/startup_lessons_learned/">lean
		startup</a>. As with most new business methodologies there is a lot of
	hype; but there is also <a
		href="http://giffconstable.com/2010/05/lean-startup-marketing-bullshit/">a
		lot of truth</a> to the lean startup idea too.</p>

	<p>The whole point of a lean start up is to triangulate in on an idea that will
	work; one that will be scalable to huge volumes; and <a href="http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/03/cash-is-not-king.html">do it as quickly as
	possible without burning through cash.</a> We are not building a company
	because we know what to do. We are building a company because <a href="http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/04/built-to-learn.html">we know how to
	figure out what to do</a>.</p>

	<p>Our goal is to cycle through iterations of our business to find new pivot
	points as quickly and cheaply as possible.  The primary tool we use to orient
	ourselves in a fast paced environment is our dynamic business model.</p>

	<h3>Don't plan; model.</h3>

	<p>As far as we are concerned there is a distinct difference between a business
	plan and a business model. A business plan is just that: a plan to make money.
	Rather than planning, a business model creates a general understanding which is
	more dynamic and more useful to us as members of The Fireworks Project.</p>

	<p>A business plan contains too much detail and makes too many assumptions.  <a href="http://steveblank.com/2010/04/08/no-plan-survives-first-contact-with-customers-%E2%80%93-business-plans-versus-business-models/">No
	plan survives first contact with customers.</a> In that blog post Steve Blank
	has a great quote which sums up the problem with business planning: "Unless you
	have tested the assumptions in your business model first, outside the building,
	your business plan is just creative writing.‚Äù</p>

	<p>So, we will not waste our time on creating a business plan. Instead we will
	focus on constantly testing and adjusting our business model.</p>

	<p>To be really useful our business model needs to present our grand view of
	the world in simple terms, but still allow us to dive into the details when
	we need to. Our business modeling tools will include graphical pictures and
	charts, but also a lot of text. It is designed to be a place where you can go
	to learn how the business works, and why we do what we do. You can explore on
	the surface to get an overview, or dive in deeper to learn about the
	details.</p>

	<p>As time goes on, we should see the delivery mechanism for our business model improve.
	Right now it is a primitive hodge podge of HTML, SVG documents, and images. If we
	improve our modeling tools, we can increase the speed at which we triangulate
	a successful business model.</p>

<a name="ooda"></a>
<div id="ooda">
	<h2><strong>OODA;</strong> Observe, Orient, Decide, Action.</h2>

	<p>The process of discovery has a methodology attached to it with military roots.
	It is called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_Loop">OODA loop (for observe, orient, decide, act)</a>.  The main
	contributing factor to the success of an OODA loop is speed.  Boyd, the author
	of OODA sums up the purpose of this loop and the advantage of speed:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>"In order to win, we should operate at a faster tempo or rhythm than our adversaries--or, better yet, get inside [the] adversary's Observation-Orientation-Decision-Action time cycle or loop. ... Such activity will make us appear ambiguous (unpredictable) thereby generate confusion and disorder among our adversaries--since our adversaries will be unable to generate mental images or pictures that agree with the menacing as well as faster transient rhythm or patterns they are competing against."</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Granted, OODA is influenced by the military, so terms like "win" and
	"adversaries" are used. Nonetheless, Boyd's emphasis on speed is taken to heart
	at The Fireworks Project.</p>

	<p>The goal is to cycle through the OODA loop as quickly and cheaply as possible.
	The faster we iterate on our business model, the sooner we can find one that is
	scalable and repeatable. So, our primary focus at this stage in the game is to
	eliminate inneficiencies that are slowing the OODA loop.</p>

	<ol id="ooda-points">
		<li>
			<h3>Observe</h3>
			<p>Get out there. What are people saying about the market? What are they saying
			about our products and services?</p>
			<p>Meanwhile, we need to constantly measure everything that is reasonably
			measureable. Collect data and look for patterns.</p>
			<p>Also, look inward on this iteration of the OODA loop. What mistakes
			did we make? Could it have been more efficiently executed?</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Orient</h3>
			<p>Orient ourselves using our <a href="#framework">market
				creation framework</a>. Use the framework to find where the markets
			are, get the pulse of existing markets, and discover ways to create new
			markets.</p>
			<p>Also, reorient ourselves on the OODA loop. What innefficiencies did we
			observe in this iteration? Are there better ways to observe the markets
			and our own production process? How can we make the decision process
			faster? What are the bottlenecks in our execution process?</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Decide</h3>
			<p>Make a decision. Assess the the situation using our measured data and our
			market creation framework. Don't be affraid to lean on our intuition and
			gut feelings.</p>
			<p>Make decisions to improve the efficiency of the OODA loop. How might
			we improve the speed and effectiveness of the next iteration?</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Action</h3>
			<p>Take action. We've already made decisions regarding the most efficient
			way to make the next iteration on our business model; now do it. The
			ability to execute will become our greatest asset.</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
</div><!-- end #ooda -->

<a name="purpose"></a>
<div id="purpose">
	<h2><strong>Purpose;</strong> make a statement.</h2>

	<p>Throughout the OODA loop it will help to have a central purpose in mind.  This
	purpose should be revisited and revised on every iteration of the loop; just
	like every other aspect of our business. However, there is one constant the
	will remain in place throughout all of our interations: The Fireworks Project
	exists to <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/01/work-on-stuff-that-matters-fir.html">build something that matters</a>.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>The Fireworks Project mission: to build, organize, and integrate internet applications, making them universally accessible and useful for everyone.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Internet technologies are advancing rapidly and have been disjointed as a
	consequence. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_innovations">Early technology adopters</a> have no problem thriving
	in the fractured environment of internet application technology; that much we
	know. However, the same characteristics of internet technologies that excite
	early adopters is preventing the majority of potential internet application
	users from accessing the tremendous utility that internet technology is able to
	deliver. This is where our opportunity lies.</p>

	<p>We do not take the stance that the pace of innovation needs to be slowed, but
	that we can package fractured internet technology as a whole product for
	late majority adopters while continuing to innovate at a rapid pace. The
	majority of the potential market for any technological innovation exists with
	the pragmatic individuals that need it packaged and delivered in a way which
	allows them to immediately put it to use. As this is written in 2010, there is
	no market sector that achieves that.</p>

	<p>Imagine yourself in 1908, riding in a horse drawn carriage, going past a broken
	down motorist stuck on the side of the road. In those days motoring was a
	hobby, mostly enjoyed by wealthy individuals. You would probably scoff from the
	seat of your carriage and carry on, shaking your head. Why would somebody waste
	so much money on such a useless toy?</p>

	<p>Then, several years later, around 1914, cars became more affordable and
	reliable, thanks to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_line">assembly lines of the Ford Motor company</a>. Now as
	more of your neighbors are purchasing cars you begin to see their usefulness.
	Soon, your pragmatic nature convinces you that owning a car may actually be a
	good idea.</p>

	<p>The early adopters of automobiles were tinkerers. The same is true of internet
	technologies today. We want to change that so that everyone with internet
	access, early adopters and pragmatic followers alike, has access to useful
	internet applications.</p>
</div><!-- end #purpose -->

<a name="framework"></a>
<div id="framework">
	<h2><strong>Orientation;</strong> A Framework for new markets.</h2>

	<p>The second phase of our OODA loop is orientation. Most of our ability to
	reorient ourselves comes from our own life experiences, environment, and our
	intuition. However, we can also construct a dynamic framework to help us
	reorient our business model based on our observations. This framework should
	never be set in stone, but revised on each iteration of the OODA loop.</p>

	<h3>Noncustomers</h3>

	<ul>
	<li>First tier, refusing customers. (todo: explain)</li>
	<li>Second tier, soon to be noncustomers. (todo: explain)</li>
	<li>Third tier, ignored customers. (todo: explain)</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Tactics for creating markets out of noncustomers.</h3>

	<h4>Build the future. (What is our leap of faith idea?)</h4>

	<p>Mark Zuckerberg commented that if he didn't build Facebook "somebody else would
	have." He obviously had a clear understanding that there was a trend line which
	predicted the success of Facebook. However, while plenty of people predicted
	it, he is the only one who actually built it.</p>

	<p>One of the biggest differentiators of wildly successful firms is not so much
	that they predict the future, but that they define it. It may seem that Mark
	Zuckerberg is being humble by quipping that somebody else would have built
	Facebook if he didn't; but the fact of the matter remains that he did build it.</p>

	<p>By his own admission everyone saw the trend, but Mark will be a billionaire
	because he <em>built</em> the future that everyone else <em>predicted</em>.  What do you get
	by predicting the future? You get to say "I was right", along with millions of
	other people.</p>

	<p>So, the goal of The Fireworks Project is not necessarily to be "right" about
	our predictions, but to build a firm that will <em>make</em> our predictions right.
	What is our leap of faith?</p>

	<h4>Pick the right fights.</h4>

	<p>We'll carefully choose how and where we compete.  The armies of Napoleon
	Bonaparte and George Washington were able to defeat larger and better
	equipped forces because they chose the battles to fight; and they defined how
	they would be fought.</p>

	<p>The point here is not quible over the need for better enterprise software
	or a more user friendly social network platform. Anyone can build better
	alternatives to Microsoft or Facebook, but copying the market view of of
	these giants is a fool's errand. Instead, think about the places where
	Microsoft, Facebook, Google, or Apple are uncomfortable.  Where are they
	unable to go, and what are the unwilling to do?  </p>

	<p>Of course the only way to have a contrarian model of the World, is to
	understand the models we are running contrary to. Fighting in the woods is
	contrary to fighting pitched battles out in the open. We need to find the
	woods and the jungles.</p>

	<h4>Appeal to emotion.</h4>

	<p>As this is written in September of 2010 Apple Inc. has hit a lifetime high of
	$285 per share. Their iPhone and iPad products are continuing to exceed market
	expectations.  Everyone wants to follow the Apple formula for success, and for
	good reason.</p>

	<p>Perhaps the most valuable lesson to learn from Apple is that emotional appeal
	matters.  Apple did not invent the mp3 player, the smartphone, or the tablet.
	What Apple did is make massive numbers of people desire these products to such
	extent that they are willing to pay high margin prices for them.</p>

	<p>Apple did this by creating appealing designs and unmatched utility for their
	products.  Their attention to user experience design created a feedback loop
	with their devoted customers; the Apple tribe. This feedback loop has generated
	a level of desire so strong that in some circles having an Apple product is
	considered a need.</p>

	<p>There is an old adage in the advertising industry:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>"Every man is actually two men. The man he is, and the man he wants to be."</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Other market players falter because they forget to appeal to human emotion and
	believe their products will stand on their technical merits alone. Apple's
	success shows this to be a dangerous assumption. (The Zune anybody?)</p>

	<p>We need to find the places in the market that have not been introduced to
	emotional appealing products and services. Apple found the mp3 player, smart
	phone, and tablet markets were weak in this area. What markets can we find?</p>

	<h4>Find a niche that does not yet exist.</h4>

	<p>One of the worst things we could do is attempt to be the best player within
	some existing technology market. That instict is part of our consumer
	mentality, and it is not healthy for an entrepreneurial mentality.  If we based
	our business on building a better word processing system, we would have to
	fight for our lives just to squeeze out a meager living.  The entrepreneurial
	attitude is to invent a new market where we are the <em>only</em> player (at least for
	a little while).</p>

	<p>Creating a new market requires that we understand the whole market
	ecosystem.  Buyers have plenty of choices in front of them and they will
	always make the one that most suites their needs and appeals to them on an
	emotional level the most. It is these choices that buyers are making within
	fractions of a second that form market dynamics.</p>

	<p>For example, small business customers will evaluate online software against an
	actual physical filing cabinet, email, Excel, Google Apps, and even a pen and
	paper.  These things all have different forms and functionality, but they all
	serve the same purpose.  They allow a small business manager to organize
	information in a way that is good enough to effectively manage their business.</p>

	<p>To explore outside existing functionality we need to understand what a market
	is trying to achieve in the broadest terms.  For example, small businesses are
	not really out looking for an "enterprise resource management system"; what
	they are really looking for is a way to get more done in less time without
	having to worry about the day to day details of the business.</p>

	<p>When we help a segment of the population meet their objectives in a way that is
	obviously superior to their current mode of operation, we have found a niche
	market that does not exist.</p>

	<h4>Steal ideas.</h4>

	<p>Everything new is actually just a derivative. Look at Apple and Microsoft.
	Steal liberally; it's not a bad thing.</p>

	<p>(todo: more)</p>

	<h4>Get in bed with the big players.</h4>

	<p>Establish mutually beneficial ties with bigger market makers; so they have an interest in our success.</p>

	<p>(todo: more)</p>

	<h4>Discover our real customers.</h4>

	<p>Who do we actually want to sell to? Maybe everyone else forgot to market to somebody that
	actually wants to buy.</p>

	<p>(todo: more)</p>

	<h2><strong>Data</strong> to think about</h2>

	<p><em>The following data is for the US only, just to refrain from
		overwhelming ourselves at this point.</em></p>

	<ul>
	<li><p>There are about 252 million people in the US between the ages 10 - 79.</p></li>
	<li>There are probably about <a href="http://www.facebook.com/press/info.php?statistics">165 million Facebook users in the US</a>.</li>
	<li>There are about <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/01/11/twitter-growth-stats/">23 million Twitter users in the US</a>.</li>
	<li>In the US Yahoo! email has 106 million users, Windows Live* 47 million, Gmail 37 million, and AOL 36.4 million. This all accounts for <a href="http://www.email-marketing-reports.com/metrics/email-statistics.htm">226 million total web email users in the US</a>. *(Windows Live acquired Hot Mail)</li>
	<li>3 million businesses, which account for more than 30 million user accounts have <a href="http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/business/gogoogle.html">"gone Google"</a>.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>According to IT research firm AMI's latest worldwide SMB Cloud Services
	Practice, there are roughly 750,000 (12 percent) small businesses and 20,000
	(24 percent) medium-size businesses already using software as a service (SAAS).
	In addition, the survey found by looking at today's SAAS users, 78 percent of
	small businesses and 31 percent of midsize businesses are leveraging a SAAS
	plus on-premises mix (or hybrid model), while approximately only a third of
	SAAS users are using an actual pure-SAAS product.</p>

	<p>With an anticipated growth of up to $95 billion in global SMB cloud-related
	spending by 2014, the firm said it isn't a surprise to see over half of U.S.
	SMBs looking into SAAS as a potential solution. Approximately one in five U.S.
	SMBs plan to use SAAS. However, AMI said it believes that SMBs are easing into
	the concept of local plus cloud-based computing rather than leapfrogging into a
	pure-play platform.</p>

	<p>AMI's research concluded that certain applications would accelerate the need
	for on demand/cloud among SMBs from SAAS plus on-premises vendors, including
	e-mail and messaging applications, online storage and backup, and document
	management and collaboration solutions. Approximately 134,000 non-SAAS U.S. SMB
	users plan to adopt this application, according to the company's report, which
	is good news for companies like Microsoft, which not only provides hosted
	solutions like Exchange Online in its BPOS bundle, but also its ubiquitous
	"Exchange On Premises."</p>
